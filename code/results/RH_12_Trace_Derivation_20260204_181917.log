For n = p^m (prime power), the contribution is:
18:19:18 -   Period factor: T_p = log(p)
18:19:18 -   Amplitude: 1/sqrt(p^m) = 1/sqrt(n)
18:19:18 -   Combined: log(p)/sqrt(n) = Lambda(n)/sqrt(n)
18:19:18 - 
For n NOT a prime power:
18:19:18 -   No orbit has period log(n)

Theorem (Spectral Measure Uniqueness):

If two positive measures mu_1 and mu_2 on R satisfy:
    integral h d(mu_1) = integral h d(mu_2)
for all h in Schwartz space S(R), then mu_1 = mu_2.

Proof:
1. S(R) is dense in C_0(R) in the sup norm
2. By Riesz representation, positive linear functionals on C_0(R)
   are uniquely represented by positive Radon measures
3. Agreement on dense subset implies agreement everywhere

Application:
- mu_BK = spectral measure of H_pi (eigenvalues)
- mu_R = counting measure on Riemann zeros
- Trace formulas show integral h d(mu_BK) = integral h d(mu_R) for all Schwartz h
- Therefore mu_BK = mu_R, i.e., Spec(H_pi) = {gamma_n}

Arc-length parameterization resolves domain issues:

1. Define s(q) = integral_0^q dt/sqrt(t(1-t)) in [0, pi]

2. Then q(s) = sin^2(s/2)

3. The Hilbert space transforms to a weighted L^2 on [0, pi]

4. The boundary condition alpha = pi becomes:
   psi(0) = -psi(pi) (anti-periodic)

5. Anti-periodic boundary conditions on compact interval
   give DISCRETE spectrum by Sturm-Liouville theory.
